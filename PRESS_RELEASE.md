# Project Name #
> SmallTalk

## Heading ##
  > SmallTalk, for making small talk with others!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For individuals that want to improve their skills in networking and being able to communicate with others, whether it be in events, groups, or anywhere!

## Summary ##
  > Users can make a profile and see their threads to invite others to chat with them. Users can also choose a category that they would like to talk about, and then they can choose a topic that interests them that other users have posted. They can RSVP to the event, and if a user would like to check on their events, they can see the events they RSVP'd to in their profile. Users can then visit a chat room from the events section on their profile, and start chatting away!

## Problem ##
  > Networking is difficult, especially for those who are just beginning their job searches, or for those who feel shy talking to others. Lots of people dread small talk; asking once again how the weather was, getting a quick response, and sitting in awkward silence for who knows how long is never fun, and can intimidate people from making connections where its needed most.

## Solution ##
  > SmallTalk aims to give users a chance to practice making small talk with others, anonymously, so that they can build their confidence and even make a connection, just from taking a few minutes from their day chatting with someone! A user can even choose a category to talk about if they feel like they need a topic to begin with. 

## Key Technical Challenge ##
  > Getting the chatroom to function as we hope, as well as the structure of our RSVP function.
  
## Extension Opportunities ##
  > A video chat in the app itself, if they would rather communicate verbally. Users can choose to be anonymous if they'd like, otherwise they could also have their emails and other info set on their profiles.
