# Project Name #
> WeSpeak (may or may not change)

## Heading ##
  > Uniting with your community and engaging with them.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  > For individuals that want to be able to engage with their communities, and be there for each other.

## Summary ##
  > Communities can post questions or concerns about any going-on's in their community, or on current events. They can also have a poll, where people can vote on whether or not they agree or disagree on the concern or question the user posts. Users can leave comments on the post as well. On a user's profile, they will be able to input a location, and get posts based on that location.

## Problem ##
  > Communities need a platform to raise questions or concerns about what's going on around them, and be able to unite together to gather thoughts or opinions on the subject matter, as well as creating a space for others to help those that need it. During a time where interactions take on a new form, communities may find it harder to engage with each other the way they used to, or may be out of the loop in current events happening around them.

## Solution ##
  > Our platform will increase transparency within communities by allowing individuals to voice their concerns, questions, or opinions on current events or any going-on's around them. This makes it easier to adapt to this new lifestyle and create a space where users can talk about these events, as well as any concerns that they feel need to be brought up.

## Key Technical Challenge ##
  > Truly understanding the relationships between our entities and making sure they are concrete.
  
## Extension Opportunities ##
  > A liking system where users can see the posts they've liked on their profile, as well as adding this system for comments on a post.
